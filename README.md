Cinema Ticket Sales System

Develop a cinema ticket sales system that allows users to:

    Register or log in as a customer.

    View available screening rooms and their status (free/occupied seats).

    Purchase tickets for selected screenings.

    Persist the system state (rooms, occupied seats, and customers) through serialization.

Main Classes
Domain:

    Customer: name, email, password.

    Seat: number, row, status (occupied/free).

    ScreeningRoom: number, movie, seat matrix.

    Ticket: customer, screening room, seat.

    Cinema: contains a list of screening rooms and tickets.

Persistence:

    DataPersistence: methods to save and load objects using serialization.

JavaFX Interface

    Login/Registration screen.

    Screening room and movie selection screen.

    Seat visualization (free/occupied).

    Purchase confirmation.

    Optional: Summary of purchased tickets.

Persistence

    When closing the application, the cinema state is saved (cine.ser).

    On startup, the state is recovered if it exists.

Suggested Package Structure

cine/
├─ model/
   → Customer, ScreeningRoom, Seat, Ticket, Cinema
├─ view/
   → JavaFX Windows (LoginView, RoomView, etc.)
├─ controller/ 
   → Login, purchase, and navigation logic
└─ persistence/ 
   → DataPersistence.java

Development Steps

    Model the domain classes.

    Design the system state persistence.

    Implement business logic (purchases, login).

    Develop the GUI with JavaFX.

    Integrate everything using MVC.
